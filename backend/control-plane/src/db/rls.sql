-- Row-Level Security — the second line of defence.
--
-- docs/10 §Scoping rules, rule 2:
--   "Postgres RLS policies on org_id as a second line of defence, so an ORM
--    mistake can't leak across tenants."
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS EVEN THOUGH THE REPOSITORIES ALREADY FILTER
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The repository layer is genuinely good at this: every method takes a
-- `TenantScope` as its first argument, `TenantScope` is unforgeable (branded with
-- a non-exported symbol, `authorize()` is the only producer), and there is no
-- `findAll()`. That stops the *predictable* mistakes.
--
-- It does not stop:
--   * a raw `db.execute(sql\`...\`)` written at 2am for a support ticket;
--   * a new join added to an existing query that pulls in a table whose alias
--     nobody remembered to constrain;
--   * an aggregate/analytics query that groups before it filters;
--   * a future ORM upgrade that changes how a `where` on a nullable column is
--     compiled;
--   * a migration script, a backfill job, or a psql session run by a human;
--   * any code path that receives an `orgId` from the wrong variable.
--
-- Every one of those is a cross-tenant data breach in a system where the ORM is
-- the only guard. With RLS on, the worst case is an empty result set. The
-- application filter and the database policy have to BOTH be wrong on the same
-- day for data to leak, and they fail for uncorrelated reasons.
--
-- The cost is one `SET LOCAL` per transaction. That is a rounding error, and it
-- buys the answer to the first question every enterprise security review asks.
--
--
-- HOW THE APPLICATION SETS THE SESSION VARIABLE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Policies read `current_setting('app.current_org_id', true)`. The application
-- sets it per TRANSACTION, never per connection:
--
--     BEGIN;
--       SELECT set_config('app.current_org_id', 'org_7fk2m9qp3x1a', true);
--       -- ^ the `true` makes it SET LOCAL: transaction-scoped.
--       ... queries ...
--     COMMIT;
--
-- This is `withTenant(orgId, fn)` in `src/db/client.ts`. Three properties matter:
--
--   1. TRANSACTION-SCOPED. Postgres clears a `SET LOCAL` at COMMIT and at
--      ROLLBACK. A pooled connection therefore can NEVER be handed to the next
--      request still carrying the previous tenant's id. Setting it with plain
--      `SET` (session-scoped) would be a critical bug — under pgbouncer or any
--      pool it would leak the tenant across unrelated requests.
--   2. PARAMETERISED. `set_config($1, $2, true)` takes the org id as a bind
--      parameter. `SET LOCAL app.current_org_id = '...'` does not accept bind
--      parameters and would require string interpolation.
--   3. THE THIRD ARGUMENT to `current_setting(name, missing_ok)` is `true`, so an
--      unset variable raises no error — it returns NULL, and every policy below
--      then matches zero rows. FAIL CLOSED: forgetting `withTenant` makes queries
--      return nothing, which surfaces as an obvious bug in development rather
--      than as a silent full-table read in production.
--
--
-- THE ROLE MODEL
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--   app_user     the application connects as this. NOSUPERUSER, NOBYPASSRLS,
--                not the table owner. This is load-bearing: a table's OWNER is
--                exempt from its own RLS policies unless FORCE ROW LEVEL
--                SECURITY is set, and superusers and BYPASSRLS roles are exempt
--                unconditionally. If the app connects as the owner or as
--                postgres, every policy in this file is decorative.
--   app_migrator owns the tables, runs migrations. Not used at runtime.
--
-- We additionally set FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY on every table so that even the
-- owner is subject to the policies — belt and braces for the case where someone
-- points the app at the migrator role.
