/**
 * Call and trace repository interfaces.
 *
 * Same rule as `types.ts`: the scope is always the first argument, and calls are
 * workspace-scoped rather than org-scoped because a call always belongs to exactly
 * one workspace (docs/10 §Scoping rules).
 *
 * Traces are split from calls on purpose. A call row is small and queried in bulk;
 * a trace is ~30k events for a 10-minute call and is fetched one at a time
 * (docs/07 §trace viewer). In production those are two different stores — Postgres
 * for calls, ClickHouse for traces — and this split is what lets the ClickHouse
 * implementation land without touching CallRepository.
